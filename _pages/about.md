## Research Interests

My research focuses on bridging the gap between unstructured and structured data, with focus on IR and IE techniques applying to both structured and unstructured data. You can find my publications here. I am broadly interested in: 

* Knowledge Graphs
* Information Extraction
* Natural Language Processing
* Text Mining
* Semantic Web

## PhD Thesis

I defended my thesis in Semptember, 2016. The thesis got an excellent review (no grade is provided for a thesis in French univiersities) by all eight members of the evaluation comittee leaded by Prof. Bernd Amann and especially the examinors Prof. Vassilis Christophides and Prof. Marie-Christine Rousset. The electronic copy of my thesis can be accessed here(https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01466754/document).
