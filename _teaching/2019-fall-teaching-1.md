Details
=======
This is a practical seminar we offered together with Prof. Dr. Harald Sack for Karlsruhe Insitute of Technology. 
During this Seminar the students were grouped into small groups and chose a subject to work on during the semester. 
All the students projects used data released by the coding Da Vinci (hackathon)[https://codingdavinci.de/about/] initiative.
