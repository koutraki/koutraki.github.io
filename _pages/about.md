## Research Interests

During my studies in both greek and french institutions and my postDoc period at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (Germany) and Leibniz University of Hanover (Germany), I have had the opportunity to improve my research skills in Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Data Mining and Knowledge Representation. 
You can find my publications [here](https://koutraki.github.io/publications/). I am broadly interested in: 

* Knowledge Graphs
* Information Extraction
* Natural Language Processing
* Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
* Semantic Web

## PhD Thesis

My thesis is entitled 'Approaches Towards Unified Models for Integrating Web Knowledge Bases' and I defended it in Semptember, 2016. The thesis got an excellent review (no grade is provided for a thesis in French Universities) by all eight members of the evaluation comittee led by Prof. Bernd Amann and especially the examinors Prof. Vassilis Christophides and Prof. Marie-Christine Rousset. The electronic copy of my thesis can be accessed [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01466754/document).
