## Research Interests

During my studies in both national (Greece) and international (France) institutions and my postDoc period at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (Germany) and Leibniz University of Hanover (Germany), I have had the opportunity to improve my research skills in Semantic Web, Information Retrieval, Datamining and Knowledge Representation. 
You can find my publications [here](https://koutraki.github.io/publications/). I am broadly interested in: 

* Knowledge Graphs
* Information Extraction
* Natural Language Processing
* Text Mining
* Semantic Web

## PhD Thesis

My thesis is entitled 'Approaches Towards Unified Models for Integrating Web Knowledge Bases' and I defended it in Semptember, 2016. The thesis got an excellent review (no grade is provided for a thesis in French univiersities) by all eight members of the evaluation comittee leaded by Prof. Bernd Amann and especially the examinors Prof. Vassilis Christophides and Prof. Marie-Christine Rousset. The electronic copy of my thesis can be accessed [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01466754/document).
